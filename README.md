Electron Riot
=============

(Gotta love that name!)

A simple example of an Electron application using
[RIOT](http://riotjs.com) for the view layer.

This is a hack of the Electron start application.

Install
-------

-   clone it
-   npm install
-   npm start

The `dev.bat` file in `/src` starts a RIOT watcher and the application.
